The key pattern: always `await` coroutines, use `asyncio.run()` as the entry point, and never mix `asyncio.run()` with an already-running event loop.","timestamp":"2026-02-20T10:00:15Z","tool_calls":[{"tool":"bash","input":"{\"command\": \"python3 -c \\\"import asyncio; print(asyncio.__version__)\\\"\"}","output":""}]},{"role":"user","content":"[Tool result: 3.11.0]","timestamp":"2026-02-20T10:00:20Z"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Good, you're on Python 3.11 which has improved asyncio debugging. Use `PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG=1` env var to get detailed warnings about unawaited coroutines. Also note: `asyncio.gather()` is your friend for running multiple coroutines concurrently.","timestamp":"2026-02-20T10:00:30Z"}]}
