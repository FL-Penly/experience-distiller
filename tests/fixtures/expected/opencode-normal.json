Here's the key insight: the `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5` library supports JWKS validation natively.\nYou already have the jwt library. Use `jwk.Fetch` to get the JWKS from the provider URL, then pass it as the key function to `jwt.Parse`. Important gotcha: JWKS are cached but you should refresh them on 401 responses from downstream services.","timestamp":"2026-02-20T10:00:02Z","tool_calls":[{"tool":"bash","input":"{\"command\": \"cat go.mod | grep jwt\"}","output":"github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5 v5.2.1\n"}]}]}
